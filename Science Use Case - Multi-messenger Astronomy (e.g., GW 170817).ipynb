    "\n",
    "In the exciting GW 170817 event, the support of multi-wavelength data was crucial in identifing the event and discovering the unique nature of this gravitational wave detection. You can read more about the discovery and GW 170817 event here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817. The gravitational waves originated from the merger of two neutron stars, giving rise to a gamma ray burst, detected by the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope 1.74 seconds following the NS-NS merger. In addition, radio to X-ray emission follow-up observations yielded interesting results across the electromagnetic spectrum as the source brightened and faded. \n",

    "The position of GW 170817 was localized to a region with area of ~28 square degrees. However ~1.7 seconds after the GW event, Fermi detected a GRB at this location: RA=13:09:48.08, Dec = âˆ’23:22:53.3. This narrowed the search radius to a few tens of degrees, which is still quite large, of course. Several optical transient teams began searching, and the Swope SuperNova Survey detected a source in NGC 4993, designated SSS17a. \n",
