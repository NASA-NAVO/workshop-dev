    "The Story: \n",
    "\n",
    "In the exciting GW 170817 event, the support of multi-wavelength data was crucial in identifing the event and discovering the unique nature of this gravitational wave detection. You can read more about the discovery and GW 170817 event here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817. The gravitational waves originated from the merger of two neutron stars, giving rise to a gamma ray burst, detected by the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope 1.74 seconds following the NS-NS merger. In addition, radio to X-ray emission follow-up observations yielded interesting results across the electromagnetic spectrum as the source brightened and faded. \n",

    "### 1. The first step is to localize and gather basic information about the source\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of GW 170817 was localized to a region with area of ~28 square degrees. However ~1.7 seconds after the GW event, Fermi detected a GRB at this location: RA=13:09:48.08, Dec = âˆ’23:22:53.3. This narrowed the search radius to a few tens of degrees, which is still quite large, of course. Several optical transient teams began searching, and the Swope SuperNova Survey detected a source in NGC 4993, designated SSS17a. \n",
    "\n",
    "A NED search around this position might offer some more information about the source. Try a cone search at the position given above, with 30 arcsec search radius. Hint: Use astroquery.ned\n"

The large sky area covered by the serendipitous survey also means that 3XMM-DR4 is a rich resource for exploring the variety of the X-ray source populations and identifying rare source types. The catalogue contains source detections drawn from 7427 XMM-Newton EPIC observations made between 2000 February 3 and 2012 December 8; all datasets were publicly available by 2012 December 31 but not all public observations are included in this catalogue. The catalogue contains 531261 X-ray detections which relate to 372728 unique X-ray sources (covering an energy interval from 0.2 keV to 12 keV). About a third of the observations have features that may cause spurious detections (mainly the wings of bright sources and large extended emission), and it is strongly recommended to use a filter (either per source, based on the summary flag column, or per observation, based on the observation class column).

Its main elements are a number of complementary sub-programmes designed to obtain the identifications for well-defined samples of X-ray sources drawn from selected XMM-Newton fields using optical/IR spectroscopy. The programme is also supported by a substantial imaging programme, needed for the selection of the spectroscopic targets, but which is also an important resource in its own right given the large sky area and hence X-ray source sample it covers. One of the principal objectives of the programme is to obtain completely identified samples which can be used to characterise the overall XMM-Newton source population sufficiently well that the basic X-ray and optical parameters can be used to assign a statistical identification for a large fraction of all the sources in the XMM-Newton serendipitous source catalogue. The XID programme started in mid-2000. Most of the programme is now complete. The XIDResult Database collects together the main results from the XID programme in a uniform way, providing access to the individual source identifications and the key optical and X-ray data for each object. Currently in the XIDResult Database contains 3 key XID programme subsamples, the XBS (XID bright flux sample), the XMS (XID medium flux sample) and the GPS (Galactic source sample), all of which have been published or are in press.
